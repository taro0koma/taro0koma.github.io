# ABOUT

I'm studying Programming Education and I used to be a web designer.

I'd been working in web / graphic design for over 15 years since I created web pages about the rock band I belonged to when I was a college student.

After quitting my previous office a few years ago, I studied Java & Android app development at a job training school,  then I assisted instructor (and also learned) in a class machine learning using Python, and am still studying programming skills.

In my private life, I enjoy teaching my child Scratch, drawing, and programming languages (with the online programming learning service "Progate" etc).
